[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/verizon-media-2019-ais3/identity-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/verizon-media-2019-ais3/identity-frontend)

## Overview
The frontend service is a toy example generated by Golang and Bootstrap. To get hands on the tools, you can view the recommended documents at [Golang Examples](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) and [Boostrap Doc](https://getbootstrap.com/).

First make sure that your go version is later than 1.12.5, older versions may lead problem in running the frontend handler. 
To run the frontend service, run:

```
go build request_handler.go
./request_handler
```

Then view the generated page here:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```
